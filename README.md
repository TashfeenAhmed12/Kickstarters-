# Description 
This project showcases a classification model developed in Python to predict the outcome of projects at their launch. It involved comparing various models to identify the one with the best performance metrics. Additionally, the project features a clustering analysis to group similar projects, employing methods such as K-means and DBSCAN, with findings based on a comprehensive analysis of both numerical and categorical variables

# Data Dictionary
The dataset from the Kickstarter comprises detailed records of crowdfunding projects, with variables to track project goals, pledged amounts, and outcomes. It includes both numerical and categorical data, such as project names, blurbs, and temporal information about project launch and deadline dates. Additionally, it contains calculated variables like goal amounts converted to USD and time-related features engineered from the original launch and creation timestamps
