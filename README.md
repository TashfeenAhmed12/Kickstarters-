# Description 
This project showcases a classification model developed to predict the outcome of projects at their launch. It involved comparing various models to identify the one with the best performance metrics. Additionally, the project features a clustering analysis to group similar projects, employing methods such as K-means and DBSCAN, with findings based on a comprehensive analysis of both numerical and categorical variables

# Data Dictionary
The dataset from the Kickstarter comprises detailed records of crowdfunding projects, with variables to track project goals, pledged amounts, and outcomes. It includes both numerical and categorical data, such as project names, blurbs, and temporal information about project launch and deadline dates. Additionally, it contains calculated variables like goal amounts converted to USD and time-related features engineered from the original launch and creation timestamps

# Results and Insights
### Classification Model
* Identify the most influential predictors for a project's success or failure
*  Understand the relationships between various predictors (like project duration, goal amount, and promotional features) and the target variable (project success or failure)
*  Understand how each predictor influences the likelihood of a project's success.
*  Analyze the model's performance through metrics like precision and accuracy to understand its accuracy and reliability in different scenarios
*  Assess how preprocessing steps like outlier removal, null value treatment, and currency conversion have impacted the model's ability to predict project outcomes effectively.

### Clustering
* Discover patterns in fundraising goals and campaign durations across different clusters, indicating varying project ambitions and complexities
* Assess how numerical variables like USD pledge and name length contribute to the formation of different project clusters
* Gain insights into the geographic concentration of projects
